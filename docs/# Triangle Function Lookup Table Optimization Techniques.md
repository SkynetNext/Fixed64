# Triangle Function Lookup Table Optimization Techniques

## 1. Lookup Table Extension and Boundary Safety

Using an additional table entry can prevent index out-of-bounds issues, especially when handling the last element of the table.

```cpp
// Increase from 512 to 513 entries
constexpr std::array<int64_t, 513> kSinLut = {
    0x0000000000000000LL, // sin(0.00000000000000) = 0.00000000000000
    0x0000000003243F6ALL, // sin(0.00307617668249) = 0.00307617668249
    // ... more entries ...
    0x0000000100000000LL  // sin(1.57079632679490) = 1.00000000000000
};
```

This way, when accessing `kSinLut[idx + 1]`, even if `idx` is the last valid index in the table, it won't cause an out-of-bounds access.

## 2. Fixed-Point Calculation Optimization

Using direct arithmetic and shift operations can replace special fixed-point functions, significantly reducing function call overhead.

```cpp
// Before optimization
m0 = Primitives::Fixed64Mul(m0, kStepSize, kOutputFractionBits);
m1 = Primitives::Fixed64Mul(m1, kStepSize, kOutputFractionBits);

// After optimization
m0 = (m0 * kStepSize) >> kOutputFractionBits;
m1 = (m1 * kStepSize) >> kOutputFractionBits;
```

This optimization is particularly effective in fixed-point calculations, especially in high-performance environments.

## 3. Constant Calculation Simplification

Simplify step size calculation to avoid complex fixed-point division functions.

```cpp
// Before optimization
constexpr int64_t kStepSize = Primitives::Fixed64Div(
    kPiOver2, (kSinLut.size() - 2) << kOutputFractionBits, kOutputFractionBits);

// After optimization
constexpr int64_t kStepSize = kPiOver2/(kSinLut.size() - 2);
```

Using integer division directly to calculate the step value simplifies the computation process.

## 4. Removal of Unnecessary Index Checks

When the table size is properly designed and the input range is correctly limited, redundant index boundary checks can be removed.

```cpp
// Before optimization
if (idx < 0) {
    idx = 0;
    frac = 0;
} else if (idx >= static_cast<int>(kSinLut.size()) - 1) {
    idx = static_cast<int>(kSinLut.size()) - 2;
    frac = (1LL << kOutputFractionBits) - 1;
}

// After optimization - Remove the above checks
// By ensuring appropriate table size and input range, these checks become unnecessary
```

This eliminates conditional branches, improving execution efficiency, especially in situations where branch prediction might fail on modern processors.

## Conclusion

These optimizations together improve the performance of triangle function lookup table implementations while maintaining computational precision. They achieve this primarily by reducing function call overhead, simplifying arithmetic operations, and removing redundant checks. These techniques are applicable to various scenarios requiring high-performance fixed-point trigonometric function calculations.
